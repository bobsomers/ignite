# My Ignite Talks

This is a collection of the slides I've used for all of my Ignite talks. Feel
free to do whatever you want with them, though I cannot give you rights to all
of the images, since some of them were pulled from Google Images. Use the
images at your own legal peril.

## Your Presentation Sucks

*Originally given at Ignite Cal Poly, Spring 2011.*

The basic premise is that the vast majority of presentations suck, mine
included. Let's talk about a couple simple things that can make all of our
presentations a heck of a lot more interesting.

## CSC 000: Things You Need to Know by the Time You Graduate that Nobody Will Teach You

*Originally given at Ignite Cal Poly, WoW Week 2011.*

Cal Poly does a top notch job at giving you all the tools you need to have a
successful career in the tech industry, but there are many things that will
help you be productive, efficient, and healthy that simply aren't covered in
any college curriculum. This is an attempt to at least expose incoming freshman
in Computer Science and Software Engineering majors to those ideas in 5 minutes.

This talk was a bit of an experiment to see if I could ditch traditional
presentation tools and do everything with HTML 5 and JavaScript. It worked
well, but was a bit more work than I was anticipating. The source code is
included here, but your can see the actual slides at
[csc000.com](http://www.csc000.com). Because the slides are in Ignite format,
they autoadvance every 15 seconds.

## How to Destroy Your Coworkers in Office Warfare

*Originally given at Ignite Cal Poly, Fall 2011.*

You probably don't realize it, but there's a war going on in offices across
this great nation. Coworkers are attempting to destroy each other, and Nerf is
the undisputed king of office weaponry. In 5 minutes you'll get a crash course
in modern Nerf offerings, with some additional tips to ensure that you're the
one doing the destroying.

I apologize for the font embedding getting screwed up on the title slide. Dunno
what happened. It's a shame though, that was a neat font.
